## Overview

Your portfolio website now includes a complete admin interface that allows you to:

## 🚀 Quick Access

### Method 1: Browser Interface (Recommended)

1. **Navigate to Admin Page**: 
   ```
   https://johancv.com/admin
   ```

2. **Create Your First Admin User** (one-time setup):
   ```bash
   # Make the script executable
   chmod +x create-admin-user.sh
   
   # Run the script (this will fix JSON formatting issues)
   ./create-admin-user.sh https://johancv.com
   
   # Alternative: Direct curl command with proper JSON
   curl -X POST https://johancv.com/api/auth/register \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"name":"Johan Stjernquist","email":"admin@johancv.com","password":"YourSecurePassword123!"}'
   ```

3. **Login**: Use the credentials you created to access the dashboard

### Method 2: API Access (Advanced)

If you prefer direct API access or need to troubleshoot:

```bash
# Create admin user
curl -X POST https://johancv.com/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Johan Stjernquist",
    "email": "admin@johancv.com",
    "password": "your-secure-password"
  }'

# Login to get JWT token
curl -X POST https://johancv.com/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
